This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

# Next.js on Netlify Platform Starter

[Live Demo](https://nextjs-platform-starter.netlify.app/)

A modern starter based on Next.js 14 (App Router), Tailwind, and [Netlify Core Primitives](https://docs.netlify.com/core/overview/#develop) (Edge Functions, Image CDN, Blob Store).

In this site, Netlify Core Primitives are used both implictly for running Next.js features (e.g. Route Handlers, image optimization via `next/image`, and more) and also explicitly by the user code.

Implicit usage means you're using any Next.js functionality and everything "just works" when deployed - all the plumbing is done for you. Explicit usage is framework-agnostic and typically provides more features than what Next.js exposes.

## Deploying to Netlify

This site requires [Netlify Next Runtime v5](https://docs.netlify.com/frameworks/next-js/overview/) for full functionality. That version is now being gradually rolled out to all Netlify accounts.

After deploying via the button below, please visit the **Site Overview** page for your new site to check whether it is already using the v5 runtime. If not, you'll be prompted to opt-in to to v5.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/netlify-templates/next-platform-starter)

## Developing Locally

1. Clone this repository, then run `npm install` in its root directory.

2. For the starter to have full functionality locally (e.g. edge functions, blob store), please ensure you have an up-to-date version of Netlify CLI. Run:

```
npm install netlify-cli@latest -g
```

3. Link your local repository to the deployed Netlify site. This will ensure you're using the same runtime version for both local development and your deployed site.

```
netlify link
```

4. Then, run the Next.js development server via Netlify CLI:

```
netlify dev
```

If your browser doesn't navigate to the site automatically, visit [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).
